            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This Butter-Basted Spatchcock Chicken with Herb-Roasted Vegetables is a masterclass in savory, one-pan roasting. 
                By securing cubes of butter directly to the chicken with toothpicks, the meat undergoes a continuous self-basting process, ensuring every bite is incredibly succulent and rich.</p>
            
            <p>As the chicken roasts on the rack above, the melting butter and savory juices drip down to "confat" a medley of potatoes, carrots, and earthy mushrooms. 
                Seasoned with garlic and aromatic fresh rosemary, the vegetables caramelize in the golden drippings, absorbing deep, roasted flavors. 
                In just 45 minutes, you achieve a complete gourmet feast featuring crispy, buttery chicken and tender, flavor-soaked root vegetables.</p>
