                Savor the perfect harmony of smoky and savory with this lighter take on a gourmet BBQ chicken mac and cheese. 
                This recipe transforms lean diced chicken breast—perfectly seasoned with a fragrant blend of smoked paprika, garlic, and onion powder—into a succulent centerpiece glazed in a sweet and tangy mix of honey and BBQ sauce. 
                By using fat-free evaporated milk and light cream cheese, the sauce achieves a remarkably velvety, indulgent consistency that clings to every macaroni noodle without the heavy calorie count of traditional versions.

                The depth of flavor is further elevated by simmering the pasta in savory chicken stock and finishing the dish with a generous melt of sharp grated cheddar.

                It is the ultimate guilt-free comfort meal, offering a high-protein, smoky-sweet experience that is sure to become a staple in your weekly rotation.
