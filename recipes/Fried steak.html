      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A simple, no-nonsense method for cooking a T-bone that focuses on technique over tricks.
        The steak is brought ot room temperature, seasoned generously, and slowly seared to build a deep crust while keeping the inside juicy.
        Finishing with butter and fresh thyme add richness without overpowering the meat.
        Resting at the end locks everything in, giving you a tender, flavorful steak that pairs perfectly with eggs and cheese for a hearty, carnivore-style meal.
