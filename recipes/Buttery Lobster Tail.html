            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Butter-poached lobster tails represent a pinnacle of seafood luxury, defined by an incredibly silky, "melt-in-your-mouth" texture that can only be achieved through slow, gentle cooking. 
                    By carefully lifting the meat to rest atop its shell in a technique known as "piggybacking," the lobster is presented with restaurant-style elegance while remaining perfectly positioned for a consistent butter bath.</p>
               
                <p>The culinary magic occurs as the tails are submerged in an emulsion of melted butter, garlic, and bright lemon. 
                    Unlike high-heat methods like grilling or boiling which can leave seafood rubbery, poaching over low heat ensures the meat stays succulent, sweet, and saturated with rich fats. 
                    Constant basting with the fragrant garlic-lemon mixture infuses every fiber of the lobster until it reaches a tender, opaque finish.</p>
                
                <p>Completed with a scatter of fresh parsley, citrus zest, and an optional touch of chili heat, the dish is typically served immediately with the remaining "liquid gold" butter sauce drizzled over the top. 
                    It is frequently paired with creamy risotto, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread to capture the decadent juices, making it a definitive choice for celebrations and fine dining at home.</p>
