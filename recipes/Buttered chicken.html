        <!--add a picture of the final product with dimensions-->

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A simple oven-baked chicken drumstick dish made with vegetables, all cooked on one tray. 
                Baby potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms are seasoned and roasted underneath while the chicken cooks on a rack above them. 
                Each drumstick is topped with a cube of butter, which melts as it bakes and drips down, basting the chicken and vegetables below. 
                The result is golden, juicy chicken with tender, buttery roasted vegetables, all made with minimal prep and cleanup.</p>
