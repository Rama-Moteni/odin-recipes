            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Indulge in the ultimate high-protein breakfast experience with these savory, meal-prep-friendly burritos that perfectly balance hearty nutrition and bold flavor. 
                This recipe transforms lean beef mince and a dozen-and-a-half fluffy eggs into a satisfying filling, seasoned with a fragrant blend of smoked paprika, sage, and thyme. 
                Each bite is elevated by a rich Worcestershire-tomato base and a zesty drizzle of sriracha mayonnaise, all tucked inside a soft tortilla that is pan-seared in melted cheese for a signature golden-brown, crispy finish.

            <p>
                Whether you are fueling up for the day or stocking your freezer for a busy week, these burritos are designed for maximum convenience without sacrificing quality. 
                The recipe includes expert tips for achieving the lightest egg texture and a foolproof method for reheating that keeps the tortilla crunchy and the center piping hot. 
                From the first stir of the onions to the final melt of the low-fat cheese seal, this dish is a delicious way to simplify your morning routine with a gourmet touch.
