      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Master the art of the perfect home-cooked steak with this refined, butter-basted method designed for deep flavor and a flawless crust. 
        The process begins with critical preparation: allowing the steak to rest at room temperature for up to 25 minutes ensures it cooks evenly from edge to center, while thoroughly drying the surface with a napkin removes excess moisture that would otherwise steam the meat. 
        By starting with the fat cap, you render out natural beef fats to create a flavorful base for searing. 
        This recipe uniquely utilizes a medium-low heat approach, providing a controlled environment that builds a rich, mahogany crust without the risk of scorching, making it especially effective for thicker cuts.

      <p>
        The final stages of the recipe elevate the steak to restaurant standards through the classic technique of butter-basting. 
        As you lower the heat, the addition of butter and fresh thyme creates an aromatic liquid that you spoon repeatedly over the meat, infusing it with savory herbal notes and ensuring a succulent finish. 
        Crucially, the process concludes with a mandatory resting period; by resisting the urge to cut or squeeze the steak immediately, you allow the internal juices to redistribute, guaranteeing that every slice remains tender and moist. 
        This patient, detail-oriented approach turns a simple piece of meat into a sophisticated culinary experience.
